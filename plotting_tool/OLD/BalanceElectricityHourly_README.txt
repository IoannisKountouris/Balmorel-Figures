The BalanceElectricityHourly tool is the same as before, except for the following differences:

- It can read GDX files now. 
	--> Just put the gdx file that you want to display in the input folder: ./input/results/{market}/MainResults_{scenario}_{year}_{subset}.gdx

- Generation technologies, demand types and price can be given a manual colour. 
	--> For this: open the following file: ./input/manual_colors_input.xlsx and update the values to your preference.
